Stovetop
========

Just an empty HTML5 and CSS3 thing for a quick start to simple web projects. Nothing too major.


## What's in it

Stovetop contains the following files:

```
Stovetop/
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.css
│   └── style.css
└── index.html
```


## How to use it

Just download it and add your own code. Pretty simple.

And of course, remove elements and comments that aren't relevant


## Authors

Stovetop uses [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas)

Stovetop is maintained by [me](https://github.com/South-Paw) and I use it all the time, even if no one else does ;)
