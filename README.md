Stovetop
========

Just an empty HTML5 and CSS3 thing for a quick start to simple web projects. Nothing too major.


## What's in it

Stovetop contains the following files:

```
css/normalize.css
css/style.css
index.html
```


## How to use it

Just download it and add your own code. Pretty simple.
