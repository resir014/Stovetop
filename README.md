Stovetop
========

Just an empty HTML5 and CSS3 hotplate for a quick start to simple web projects. Nothing too major or complicated.


## What's in it

Stovetop contains the following files:

```
Stovetop/
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.css
│   └── style.css
└── index.html
```


## How to use it

Just download it and add your own code. Pretty simple.

And of course, remove elements and comments that aren't relevant.

Stovetop uses [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/) for showing authorship, [here's an exmaple](http://humanstxt.org/Standard.html) of how to style it.
